## Summary

7 Days to Die mod: Replace days count in UI with a day of the week.

> 🗺️ This mod is fully localized 🎉

The general idea is that the total day count is relatively meaningless to most players. Most players want to know what the day *means* for them and the recurring question many admins receive on a regular basis is "how many days till blood moon?"

If you use this mod, you'll be able to say "it happens every Sunday". No math. No second-guessing. Just simple.

> ℹ️ This mod does not alter the actual days within a game or server (many components in the game rely on server/world time increasing); it simply updates how the days are presented within the UI.

| ------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Compass | Days replaced with day of the week                                                                                                                           |
| Map     | Day/Time entry is removed                                                                                                                                    |
| Quests  | Date Completed is removed                                                                                                                                    |
| Trader  | Restock Date is removed (by default; see [Optional Vending Expiration Clock](#optional-vending-expiration-clock))                                            |
| Vending | Date/Time Clock is added to Rentable Vending for Expiration Date reference (by default; see [Optional Trader Restock Clock](#optional-trader-restock-clock)) |

### Optional Vending Expiration Clock

Because the default Rentable Vending Machines present a *target* expiration date rather than the count for the number of days remaining before machine expiration, having a reference to the current game/server day is necessary for context.

For this reason, a small date/time clock has been included in the "Product Name" column header for comparison against the Rentable Vending Machine's Expiration Day.

If you don't like the clock being here, you can disable it by swapping `Config/windows.xml` with `Config/windows-remove-vend-clock.xml`.

### Optional Trader Restock Clock

Trader Restock Day is similarly referring to the day the trader expects to restock inventory; without knowing the current day, the context for this information is completely lost.

While the same kind of Date/Time clock *can* be added for traders with a Restock Day displayed, I decided to not include this by default and instead completely remove Restock Days from the Trader UI.

> I removed the 'Restock Days' by default because I don't think the information it provides is critically necessary for the player.

If you prefer seeing a 'Restock Days' display, I have included an optional configuration that will add it back, along with a Clock to show the current Day/Time. You can enable this by swapping `Config/windows.xml` with `Config/windows-add-restock-clock.xml`.

### Days Remaining Compatibility Mode

A sister project will take the experience further - added features include:

- seeing an actually 'remaining days' count in your Vending Machine Rental instead of a specific day the expiration will happen
- an expiration reminder for your rental (including the number of remaining days)
  - each time you log into the server
  - each time the current day changes(at midnight) while on the server

If you prefer seeing the actual days remaining on a vending machine rental, install [Days Remaining](https://github.com/jonathan-robertson/days-remaining) on your server or in your P2P host and swap `Config/windows.xml` with `Config/windows-days-remaining.xml`.

> Downloading this mod on each connecting client will not be necessary; only the one hosting the game (or the dedicated server) will need it installed and everyone (except for the host in P2P games) can leave EAC enabled.

### Optional Short Day

If you want to integrate this mod into any existing mod, you can still use the same format found in line 3 of `windows.xml` to update your own compass days value.

> 🗺️ These optional short-dates are currently only available in English.

```xml
[{daycolor}]{# localization('dayOfTheWeek' + (day-1)%7)}[-] {time}
```

As a bonus, I've included short days as well - in case you're shooting for a more compact look:

```xml
[{daycolor}]{# localization('shortDayOfTheWeek' + (day-1)%7)}[-] {time}
```

## Sister Projects

This mod is designed to work well with another if you're using a dedicated server:

## Acknowledgements

This mod as it's currently written is only possible due to the brilliant efforts of another modder and his willingness to share what he learned:

**Shado47** developed the [Immersive Days](https://7daystodiemods.com/immersive-days-display/) mod that "Changes the day counter below the compass to go through weekdays, months, and years. Starts on January 1st, 2020".

If this sounds even better to you than this mod does, I would highly encourage you to check out Immersive Days.
> Just like this mod, his does not require EAC to be disabled and is able to be served from a server without any client-side downloads.
